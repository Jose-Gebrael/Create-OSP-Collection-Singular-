This is for creating a single type of card with a single type of utility, for example a Turret (type) that is a Machine-gunner (utility).
The whole collection will be this type and utility.

1)Have python installed
2)Run "pip install Pillow"
3)Change the values in Template.json
4)Have the following Folder Structure Ready:
(make sure the border images are named according to this document. Both images and borders should be 1024x1024)
(Put the borders in the BORDER folder and the images in the IMAGES subfolders accordingly)

├── BORDER/
│   ├── 1_common.png
│   ├── 2_rare.png
│   ├── 3_legendary.png
│   ├── 4_exotic.png
│   └── 5_ultra-exotic.png
├── Final/
│   ├── Images/
│   └── Metadata/
├── FONT/

├── IMAGES/
│   ├── 1_COMMON/
│   ├── 2_RARE/
│   ├── 3_LEGENDARY/
│   ├── 4_EXOTIC/
│   └── 5_ULTRA-EXOTIC/
└── Shuffled/
    ├── Images/
    ├── Metadata/
    └── NoJson/

5)Fix any text you need to set in batch_combine_images.py then run it (output location is Final subfolders)
6)Run OrderShuffle.py (output location is Shuffled subfolders)
7)Upload your images to your IPFS and get your CID (copy the images to a folder outside and give it a custom name for the IPFS hosting)
8)Put the CID into IPFS_FIX.py and run it
9)Optional: if you need the metadata without the .json extention run JsonRemover.py (for example Magiceden needs this, they dont like .json files)
10)Upload your Metadata (copy them to a folder outside and give it a custom name for the IPFS hosting)
